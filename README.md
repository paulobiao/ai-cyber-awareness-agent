# AI Cyber Awareness & Incident Triage Agent

## Problem
Non-technical users and small organizations are increasingly exposed to cyber threats,
but most security tools are designed for large enterprises and security experts.
This creates a gap where critical incidents are misunderstood, ignored, or not escalated properly.

## Solution
This project demonstrates an AI-assisted cyber awareness and incident triage agent that
generates and classifies cybersecurity-related events in real time, helping users understand
risk severity in a simple and accessible way.

## How It Works
- Simulates real-world cyber incidents (e.g., unauthorized access, outages, system warnings)
- Automatically classifies events by severity (info, warning, critical)
- Sends structured events to Elasticsearch
- Visualizes events and correlated security cases using Elastic Security

## Why It Matters
Cybersecurity awareness should not be limited to large enterprises.
Accessible tools help vulnerable users, small teams, and students better understand
digital risks and take informed action.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Elastic Cloud
- Elasticsearch
- Elastic Security

## Status
Working prototype with real-time event generation and visualization.
