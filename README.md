# AI Cyber Awareness & Incident Triage Agent

## Overview

Cybersecurity incidents impact real people — not just companies.

Non-technical users, students, and small organizations are increasingly exposed to digital threats, yet most security tools are designed for experts. As a result, critical incidents are often misunderstood, ignored, or escalated too late.

This project addresses that gap by transforming complex cybersecurity signals into clear, understandable incidents that help users decide **when they should worry and take action** — and when they should not panic.

---

## Problem

Most cybersecurity platforms assume technical expertise.

For non-technical users, this creates:
- Confusion about what is happening  
- Fear caused by unclear alerts  
- Inaction or delayed response to real threats  

Vulnerable users are left without accessible tools to understand risk severity or make informed decisions.

---

## Solution

The **AI Cyber Awareness & Incident Triage Agent** is an AI-assisted cybersecurity awareness tool designed to make security events understandable and actionable for non-technical users.

Instead of complex dashboards, the agent:
- Translates cybersecurity events into clear severity levels  
- Highlights critical incidents that require attention  
- Keeps lower-risk events informational  

The focus is **awareness, education, and clarity** — not enterprise complexity.

---

## How It Works

- Simulates real-world cybersecurity incidents  
  (e.g., unauthorized access, system warnings, outages)

- Automatically classifies events by severity  
  (`info`, `warning`, `critical`)

- Sends structured events to Elasticsearch in real time

- Visualizes events and correlated security cases using Elastic Security

---

## Why It Matters

Cybersecurity awareness should not be limited to large organizations.

Accessible tools empower:
- Individuals  
- Students  
- Small teams  

to understand digital risks and make informed decisions without needing expert-level security knowledge.

This project demonstrates how AI can reduce fear and confusion by transforming complex signals into meaningful, human-readable insights.
